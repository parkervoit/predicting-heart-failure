Heart disease is a huge issue. The question is it possible to leverage patient data to predict cases of heart failure that result in death? /n

With machine learning technology, it is completely possible. In this project, it was possible to develop a Random Tree Classifier based off of industry standard biomarkers that could predict cases of heart failure that resulted in death. Physicians could use such a tool to better predict the severe cases of heart disease. x
